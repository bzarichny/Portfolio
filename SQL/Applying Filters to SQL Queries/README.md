As a security professional, part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep systems secure. In this scenario, I discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines. 

My task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts data tables. I will use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

Note: The tables and their formats can be seen in the “Table Formats” document within this folder.
